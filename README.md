# Alpha-Fox Resources Repository

Welcome to the **Alpha-Fox Resources Repository**! This repository stores markdown files used for the Alpha-Fox website.

## Contributing

We encourage the community to contribute to the documentation. If you have improvements or additions, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes. You can also discuss potential changes directly with the community on our **Discord**, which can be found at [Alpha-Fox](https://www.alpha-fox.com/).

### Important Notes:
- **Respect is key.** Disagreements may happen, but maintaining a respectful and constructive attitude fosters a positive environment.
- **Not all markdown files are included.** Some may be added in the future when we are open to contributions.
- **File History.** Many of these files were originally written in HTML and later converted to markdown. You can check the file history to view previous versions.
- **Credit Sections.** If a markdown file contains a credit section, you are welcome to add yourself if you contributed.
- **Do not remove credit.** Even if a contribution is removed, its original contributor should still be credited to avoid unnecessary disputes.
- **Ignore "last updated" text.** This is managed by Alpha-Fox and does not need to be manually updated.
