When you first set up your Stargate, it generates a unique username and password. Be sure to write these down, as they
grant access to both the forums and the online interface.

If your username changes in Second Life, your login username will also change, however you may need to have a Stargate
rezzed out before this change can be detected.

## Which username should you use to login

You should use your legacy name, i.e. for [ash.qin](https://my.secondlife.com/ash.qin) you would use "Ash Qin" or
for [subnova](https://my.secondlife.com/subnova) you would use "Subnova Resident".

## Obtaining a Stargate

If you don't have a Stargate yet, you can get one here: [Get a Stargate](https://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/)

## How to Reset Your Password

In case you forget your password or didn't save it, you can reset it using your Stargate. The gate offers multiple
functions, including the ability to restart if it crashes or freezes.

To reset your password, follow these simple steps:

- Rez your Stargate.
- Enter the following command in chat: **/stargate resetpass**

Executing this command will reset your password, allowing you to log back into the website.
