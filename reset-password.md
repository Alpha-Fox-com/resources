    <p>When you first set up your Stargate, it generates a unique username and password. Be sure to write these down, as they grant access to both the forums and the online interface.</p>
    <p>If your username changes in Second life, your login username will also change, however you may need to have a Stargate rezzed out before this change can be detected.</p>
