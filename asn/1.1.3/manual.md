      <p><em>In order to recieve the latest updates and other important information, be sure that you join the <strong>Alteran Stargate Network</strong> group</em><strong>.</strong><em> You can also access the forums at </em><a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/community/"><em><strong>http://www.alpha-fox.com/community/</strong></em></a>.</p>

      <h2>Section 1 - Setting up your Stargate<a name="s1" id="top2" /></a> </h2>
<h3>1.1 - Basic Setup<a name="s1.1" id="top3" /></a> </h3>
<p>	When you first rez your Stargate, it will provide you with a username and password. Please write that down, because it is your ticket to both the forums and the <em><a href="#s5">online interface</a></em>.</p>
<p>Once your Stargate is rezzed, you simply have to move your Stargate into position. See <em>Section 1.3</em> for tips on how to position your Stargate. If you wish to use a <em><a href="#s3.2">Dial Home Device</a></em> with your Stargate, you may rez one from the folder where you recieved the Stargate and this user guide. A <em>Dial Home Device</em> is a keypad basically that allow you to &quot;dial up&quot; glyphs of a target Stargate. Once you push the glyphs and then the center button, it will attempt to lock and either fail or open up to your destination.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are not the &quot;primary&quot; or first Stargate in your region, you will only be able to contact your Stargate via the <em>name</em> or <em>alias</em>. See <em><a href="#s1.2">Section 1.2</a></em> for more details on renaming your Stargate, or <em><a href="#s2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a></em> for more details on how the addressing system works.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>1.2 - Customizing your Stargate<a name="s1.2" id="top4" /></a> </h3>
<p>Once you setup your Stargate, you are ready to go. However if you want to be able to be contacted using a special word or want to display a different name for your Stargate on the webpage, you can do this easily in-world.<strong> </strong>The in-world interface is <strong>not</strong> the only method of customizing your Stargate, see <em><a href="#s5">Section 5</a></em> for more details on customizing your Stargate via the online interface.</p>
<p>There are currently two ways to customize your Stargate via the in-world interface:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The menu you obtain by touching the Stargate</li>
	<li>The <a href="#s4.2">Stargate API</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This section of the guide is going to detail the menu-method of customizing your Stargate.</p>
<p>When you click the Stargate, you will obtain a menu. You should see a menu with buttons in the top-right hand corner of your screen. All of the customizations you are going to want to do are in the <em>Settings</em> portion of the menu, so click that button. On the next menu that pops up, you have several choices. I will try to document each choice below.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Random</strong> - This button will allow you to toggle whether or not your Stargate will be chosen in a random dial. If you place your Stargate in a region with <em>Direct Teleport</em> turned off, this will be locked to the <strong>No</strong> position.</li>
	<li><strong>Image URL</strong> - On the website, your Stargate can be represented by a small <strong><em>256px </em>by <em>256px</em></strong> image. When you click this button, the Stargate will respond with a channel that you can say the URL of your image on. Once you respond with your image URL, it will be automatically set.

<ul>
			<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do not have your own server to host images from, we recommend <em>Photobucket</em> (<a href="http://www.photobucket.com/">http://www.photobucket.com/</a>), <em>Flickr </em>(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com/</a>)<em>, </em>or<em> TinyPic</em> (<a href="http://www.tinypic.com">http://www.tinypic.com</a>).</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
  <li><strong>Shield</strong> - Your Stargate is packaged with <em>4</em> types of shields. This menu will allow you to change between these with a click of a button.
		The following shield types are available.

		<ul>
			<li><em>Shield</em> - This is a built-in shield requiring no extra prims on your parcel. It is not animated, however, but resembles the shield seen in <strong>Stargate: Atlantis</strong>.</li>
			<li><em>Rezzed</em> - This is a rezzed shield requiring 3 extra prims on your parcel. This is an animated shield with glow added to the prim. This resembles the shield seen in <strong>Stargate: Atlantis</strong>.</li>
		  <li><em>Iris</em> - This is a simple animated iris. It resembles the iris seen in the <em>SGC</em> in <strong>Stargate: SG-1</strong>.</li>
		  <li><em>Disabled</em> - This will disable all built-in shields, to allow for possible 3rd-party  shields to be integrated. See <em><a href="#s4.1">Section 4.1</a></em> for more information on using the API to create a 3rd-party shield.</li>
	</ul>

  </li>
	<li><strong>Listen</strong> - Some people like to use their own relays for dial commands. For this purpose, we implemented a way to turn off the channel-0 listen. Clicking this button will allow you to disable listening on the public-0 channel.

		<ul>
			<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The listen on channel 123 will always be active, as a convience to gate users.</li>
	    </ul>

  </li>
	<li><strong>Output</strong> - Some people like to use their own devices to output what the gate is currently saying. For this purpose, we implemented a way to turn off the channel-0 output. Clicking this button will disable output on the public channel.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The output for menu commands (which must be done within range of the gate) will remain always on channel 0.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - This button will allow you to change the <em>name</em> of your Stargate. This name will be used to identify your Stargate in the logs, on incoming wormholes, and on the website. When you click this button, the Stargate will respond with a channel that you can say your Stargate's name on. Once you respond with your name, it will be automatically set.</li>
	<li><strong>Alias </strong>- Each Stargate is assigned an alias, to make dialing via <em>direct dial</em> easier. This alias can be something as simple as &quot;zach's house&quot; or &quot;lex's pad.&quot; When you click this button, the Stargate will respond with a channel that you can say your  Stargate's alias on. Once you respond with your alias, it will be automatically set.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>1.3 - Tips on Location<a name="s1.3" id="top5" /></a> </h3>
<p>There is nothing that you may hate more than coming out of a Stargate in a building where you cannot find your way out, flying in the sky, or coming through backwards. These tips will allow you to setup your Stargate to give the most pleasing experience to a Stargate traveler.</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Do not place your Stargate in the air</em> - Obviously if you are making a Spacegate scene or something in space, this is unavoidable. However, placing the Stargate in the air in order for people to fall to their laggy dooms is generally a bad practice. Please try to refrain from doing this.</li>
	<li><em>Place your Stargate in an open area</em> - We are aware from personal experience that teleporting into a location where the exit is not visible is a very annoying experience. Please try to place your Stargate in an open area, not a small boxed in room with no way out. Random gate travelers will definately thank you for not locking them away in a dungeon!</li>
	<li><em>Keep your Stargate rotated to the North<strong> - </strong></em>The Stargates are based on the llMapDestination method of teleporting. In this function, the LOOK_AT variable is not used, nor supported. Because of this, you may appear facing backwards in the gate, sideways, etc. Placing your gate facing north will always make incoming travelers appear facing outwards from the Stargate.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>1.4 - Custom Sounds<a name="s1.4" id="top6" /></a></a></h3>
<p>Some people wish to customize the sounds the Stargate plays for various events, such as incoming wormholes, a spinning ring, or the kawoosh. Some of these sounds were made so custom sounds could be inserted in their place. The currently compatable sound clips are listed below.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>windup</strong> - This is the sound your Stargate makes when the inner ring starts to spin.</li>
	<li><strong>outloop</strong> - This is the sound your Stargate makes when the inner ring loops the spinning sound.</li>
	<li><strong>incloop</strong> - <em>(Pegasus Stargate <strong>only</strong>)</em> This is the sound your Stargate makes when the inner ring loops the spinning sound (for incoming wormholes).</li>
	<li><strong>chevron test</strong> - The sound the Stargate makes when it tests all 9 of the chevron lamps.</li>
	<li><strong>chevron encode</strong> - This is the chevron sound played when you lock a symbol with the DHD.</li>
	<li><strong>chevron engage</strong> - This is the chevron sound played when you lock a symbol with an incoming wormhole.</li>
	<li><strong>chevron lock</strong> - This is the chevron sound played when you lock a symbol with any other method (i.e. long SGC-style dialing)</li>
	<li><strong>reset</strong> - The sound your Stargate plays when it performs a reset.</li>
	<li><strong>restart</strong> - The sound your Stargate plays when it performs a restart.</li>
	<li><strong>interference</strong> - When a Stargate interferes with another in the same region it generally plays a zapping sound. This is the sound you want to have to replace it.</li>
	<li><strong>open wormhole</strong> - The<em> KAWOOSH!</em> sound in your Stargate.</li>
	<li><strong>force wormhole</strong> - When a wormhole is forced open (similar to the asgard / nox style), this sound is played.</li>
	<li><strong>close wormhole</strong> - The wormhole collapse sound at the end of a wormhole.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must call <em>/stargate reset</em> before these sound changes will take effect.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>1.5 - Custom Lights<a name="s1.5" id="top42" /></a></a> </h3>
<p>Your Stargate has the ability to adjust the on / off color of the gate lamps via a notecard. When looking into the inventory of the Stargate, you will see a notecard called <strong>chevrons.config</strong>. When you view this notecard, you will see something similar to this.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: #EFEFEF; border: 1px dotted #333333;">Chevron Configuration - Set line 2 to the &lt;r, g, b&gt; for the off color. Set line 3 to the &lt;r, g, b&gt; for the on color.<br />
<0, 0, 0><br /><1, 1, 1></blockquote>
<p>Remember, these lines <strong>must</strong> stay the same or they won't work. Issuing a <em>/stargate restart</em> command after changing this notecard will save the settings. The Stargate will then &quot;recalibrate&quot; itself and the new colors will be spread.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Section 2 - Using your Stargate<a name="s2" id="top7" /></a></a></h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Any of these commands can be said on either <strong>channel 0</strong> (public) or <strong>channel 123</strong> (for privacy).</p>
<h3>2.1 - Dialing the Stargate<a name="s2.1" id="top8" /></a></a></h3>
<p>Dialing the Stargate is fairly easy, you just need to know the proper command to use. Most dialing can be accomplished using a simple command, <em>&quot;/dial&quot;</em>. This dial command will search all of the keywords a Stargate can support, which are <em>name</em>, <em>alias</em>, <em>region</em>, and <em>addresses</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>To dial a Stargate that is of the same type as you, say <strong>/dial &lt;keyword&gt;</strong><em> &quot;/dial sonamu&quot;</em></p>
	<p>To dial a Pegasus Stargate from a Milkyway gate, say <strong>/dial pegasus &lt;keyword&gt;</strong><em> &quot;/dial pegasus sonamu&quot;</em></p>
	<p>To dial a Milkyway Stargate from a Pegasus gate, say <strong>/dial milkyway &lt;keyword&gt;</strong> <em>&quot;/dial milkyway sonamu&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have a Milkyway Stargate, you can also dial your Stargate using the slower <em>SGC</em> style of dialing. This is accomplished by replacing the <strong>/dial</strong> with <strong>/sgc</strong>. This is when the Stargate's inner ring rotates freely to each glyph and locks it in using the top chevron (chevron 7). This, however slow, provides a much more authentic dialing effect.</p>
<p>There are two other Stargate networks currently present in the Second Life &reg; world; <strong>Open Stargate Network</strong> (<a href="http://www.ma8p.com/~opengate/">http://www.ma8p.com/~opengate/</a>) and the Cleary Stargate Network (<a href="http://www.aristoi.org/gatenetwork/">http://www.aristoi.org/gatenetwork/</a>). We currently are working on stablizing this network, so we have no connections to either of these networks. Connections to both are planned in the future, however.</p>
<p>All of the networks can be replaced by shorter versions, called &quot;short prefixes.&quot; A list of allowed prefixes follows.</p>

<p>To dial a gate using a Dial Home Device, you must have the glyph address of the Stargate you want to dial. You can find a list of all Stargates in the <strong>Alteran Network</strong> on the website (<a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/">http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/</a>). You can also use the glyph display included with the Stargate to find addresses to dial.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>2.2 - Iris / Shield System<a name="s2.2" id="top9" /></a></a></h3>
<p>Your Stargate is equipped with a shield / iris system. This prevents unwanted visitors from coming to your Stargate by blocking teleport.</p>
<p>To operate your Stargate's shield / iris system, use the following commands:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>/stargate raise</strong> - To raise the gate shield / close the iris</li>
	<li><strong>/stagate lower</strong> - To lower the gate shield / open the iris</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the <a href="#s4">Stargate API</a> to control the iris.</p>
<p>If your gate's iris is closed when you want to dial it from another location, you will be blocked out unless you have an object on the other side that you can signal to open the iris via the <em>send chatter</em> <a href="#s4">API command</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>2.3 - Other Commands<a name="s2.3" id="top10" /></a></a></h3>
<p>Your gate has other functions that you will need such as the main reset / restart if the gate freezes in mid-dial or crashes. You can also use your gate to reset your password for logging into the website in the event that you forget it or didn't think to write it down.</p>
<p>Hwere are all the commands that your gate uses, excluding those mentioned above. Some are <strong>public </strong>(accessed by anybody) and others are<strong> private </strong>(accessed by only the owner).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Private</strong>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>/stargate reset</strong> - This will reset your Stargate</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate offline</strong> - This will set your Stargate to the <em>offline</em> mode. Please note that you must use the menu / API to turn it back online. No public commands will work.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate restart</strong> - This will hard-reset your Stargate.<strong> You will lose all settings (random listing, public listen status, etc) if you choose to do this.</strong></li>
		  <li><strong>/stargate resetpass</strong> - This allows you to reset the password for your account on the Alpha-Fox online interface.</li>
		  <li><strong>/stargate raise</strong> - This raises the shield / iris of the Stargate in question.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate lower</strong> - This lowers the shield / iris of the Stargate in question.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate test</strong> - This tests the chevron lamps on the Stargate.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate test incoming</strong> - This simulates an incoming wormhole on your Stargate.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate test outgoing</strong> - This simulates an outgoing wormhole on your Stargate.</li>
		</ul>

  </li>
	<li><strong>Public</strong>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>/stargate version</strong> - This returns the version of the Stargate in question.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate name</strong> - This returns the name of the Stargate in question.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate alias - </strong>This returns the alias of the Stargate in question.</li>
			<li><strong>/stargate help</strong> - Returns a quick help for anybody needing it.</li>
	  </ul>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>When your Stargate is active, it has the ability to relay chat (using the <a href="#s4">Stargate API</a>) and region statistics. The chat buffer is limited to 20 messages per 4(ish) seconds.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>2.4 - Menu System<a name="s2.4" id="top11" /></a></a></h3>
<p>When you click on your Stargate, a menu pops up with many commands available that you can use, without remembering tedious chat commands. Each of the menu entries are explained below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subnova</strong> - Contacts the Alteran Stargate Network HQ.</li>
	<li><strong>Top Gates</strong> - Lists off the top 20 gate names and regions by popularity.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistics</strong> - Outputs statistics on incoming and outgoing wormholes to your Stargate.</li>
	<li><strong>Version</strong> - Outputs the current version of your Stargate.</li>
  <li><strong>Help</strong> - Outputs a quick help to those in need of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Settings</strong> - Allows you to <a href="#s1.2">change settings</a> in your Stargate.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary</strong> - Gives a link to the webpage for your Stargate.</li>
  <li><strong>Controls - </strong>Allows you to give commands to the gate such as <em>Reset</em>, <em>Restart</em>,<em>Delete</em>, and <em>Offline</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory</strong> - Allows you to get a dump of the memory levels of every Stargate script. An easy way to find out if a script has crashed.</li>
  <li><strong>Report</strong> - Allows you to report a Stargate for a SSoP violation, such as within access lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Rate</strong> - Allows you to rate a Stargate location on a scale of 0 - 5.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>2.5 - Technical Information<a name="s2.5" id="top12" /></a></a></h3>
<p>This area is very technical. We will most likely sound like Samantha Carter here from this point on.</p>
<h4>2.5.1 - Server, Communications , Continuity<a name="s2.5.1" id="top13" /></a></a></h4>
<p>The Stargates are a highly advanced piece of technology, and we felt how they work should be explained a bit in detail. Each Stargate registers itself on the &quot;network&quot; which is based on a MySQL database using PHP to interface. The gate backend server handles most of the communication and information, leaving in the in-world gates basically dumb-terminals. The server which the gates run on is named <em>Chimera</em> and is hosted on the <a href="http://www.subnova.com/">Subnova Network</a> (<a href="http://www.subnova.com/">http://www.subnova.com/</a>). This server unlike our original, <em>Daedalus,</em> is hosted with a UPS backup and a Static IP address.</p>
<p>Communications are handled using <em>AFVI </em>servers (a.k.a. Alpha-Fox Virtual Interface) developed by Alpha-Fox. We decided to scrap using <strong>XML-RPC</strong> because of its frequent instablity and <strong>email -&gt; lslmail</strong> because of dropped emails. The <em>AFVI </em>system basically sends out lslmails from saved queries in our SQL database. The system is fairly fast, a round trip communication without any problems taking around <em>3 seconds</em>. It is also verifiable, meaning that we can make sure that the message we sent to the Stargate was recieved.</p>
<p>Each of the Stargates check in every <strong>5 minutes</strong>, and status changes are registered as soon as they happen. For this reason, the status of every Stargate is known at every time. People may think that the check-in time is too slow, but we figured that since the gates will fail to lock if communications can not reach them, dead gates hanging on the network for a few minutes will not make a big deal. If a gate fails to check in for more than 6 minutes, it will take the gate offline and continue on. If that gate decides to check in again, it will return registered with all of its previous settings. The dead gate list is cleared every 72 hours.</p>
<h4>2.5.2 - Addressing System<a name="s2.5.2" id="top14" /></a></a></h4>
<p>Each region on the grid is given 2 addresses, a <em>native</em> address, and a <em>cross-network</em> address. Simply put, your Stargate will always recieve the same address. It will have that address (the <em>native </em>address) always for somebody with the same type Stargate to contact you with. The <em>cross-network</em> address allows somebody with a Stargate other than the type you have (for example, your gate is milkyway and the other gate is pegasus) to dial your gate using the extra 8th glyph.</p>
<p>Each Stargate is also assigned a <em>SGC-ID</em> which is similar to the addressing used by the SGC and Atlantis. (e.g. P4X-639) This is generated from your address and will <strong>never</strong> be similar to another gate's <em>SGC-ID</em>. You can use this to dial your gate using direct dialing.</p>
<p>The Milkyway Stargate has 39 symbols on its inner ring. Our index is 0-38 for those glyphs. Glyph 0 is the &quot;point of origin&quot; and will always be the last glyph you enter in an address. On a standard Stargate DHD, there are 38 symbols on the panel (1-38). The point of origin is removed from the DHD panel and is assumed to be the <strong>BOB </strong>(big orange button) in the center.</p>

<p>The Pegasus Stargate, however, has a more difficult setup. In order to accommodate the LED dialing method, they had to put 36 glyphs on the gate. This presents a problem because in order to keep the DHD symmetrical they had to put 36 buttons also on the DHD. Therefore, the point of origin (which is assumed to be the big orange button on the Milkyway Stargates) is a glyph as well as the <strong>BBB</strong> (big blue button). To resolve this, you must require that the 0 glyph be pressed on your Stargates <em>before</em> the BBB.</p>

<p> The addresses are provided by the server <em>Andromeda</em> on the <a href="http://www.subnova.com/">Subnova Network</a> (<a href="http://www.subnova.com/">http://www.subnova.com/)</a>, and take approximately <strong>1 day</strong> to generate addresses for the 14000+ regions on the grid. We keep an active database of every region in the grid, so addresses are generated as new sims are added.</p>
<p>Because of the addressing system above, it is limited to 1 gate per type, per region. This means that there can be 1 pegasus and 1 milkyway gate in your region at any one time that can be dialed via address. This does <strong>not</strong> mean there cannot be more than 1 gate in a region; they just must be dialed using their <em>name</em> or <em>alias</em>.</p>
<p>To add something fun, you can apply for an admin-assigned &quot;forward address.&quot; Basically, these addresses are ones that will not be generated automatically by our systems. An example of one is being assigned the SGC's address in the show for a Stargate that is inside of a realistic looking SGC. You could then dial that gate either by your address, or your forward address. </p>
<p>If you want to apply for a forward address, submit a request in the <em><a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/support/">Help Desk</a></em> (<a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/support/tickets/">http://www.alpha-fox.com/support/tickets/</a>). Be sure to include the gate location, and the address you want so we can evaluate your request.</p>
<h4>2.5.3 - Failsafes / Limitations<a name="s2.5.3" id="top17" /></a></a></h4>
<p>When creating the gates, we decided to make them as canon as possible and integrated some of the failsafes and limitations of the Stargates. </p>
<p>For example, only one Stargate of the same type can be active at a time. If a Stargate is active and another Stargate (of the same type) tries to dial out, it will fail. On the flipside, if a Stargate is active and somebody tries to dial into another Stargate in the region (of the same type), it will fail. </p>
<p>If one gate is dialing, and the primary Stargate gets incoming, the primary Stargate always wins. Reversed, if one gate is dialing and the primary dials out, the primary Stargate always wins. </p>
<p>This kept with the idea in the show that the primary Stargate has dominance over any other Stargate in the area. These limitations are also implemented because of scripting limitations, for example if 5 Stargates in a region activated within a short period of time the HTTPRequests would throttle and the gates would malfunction and possibly bring down sim performance.</p>

<h2>Section 3 - Stargate Official Addons<a name="s3" id="top15" /></a></a></h2>
<h3>3.1 - Death System<a name="s3.1" id="top16" /></a></a></h3>
<p>Death is an addon developed by <em>Alpha-Fox</em> that allows the unstable vortex and other lethal actions of the Stargate to kill persons on safe land. When the server is deeded to the parcel group and turned on, it is &quot;active&quot; and the gate will use it to cause deaths of people who get caught in the unstable vortex.</p>
<p>This addon also has an API, so people can adapt things to use this death system. This will listen throughout the entire region, so only one Death system needs to be rezzed per group / owner.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently this needs to be bolded in giant-omg text.</p>

<h3>3.2 - Dial Home Devices<a name="s3.2" id="top19" /></a></a></h3>
<p>The Stargate package is equipped with 4 DHDs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Milkyway</strong> - This is a lite version of the OS DHD or &quot;Dial Home Device&quot; by <a href="http://www.oslabs.info/">OS Labs</a> (<a href="http://www.oslabs.info/">http://www.oslabs.info/</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Pegasus</strong> - This is a lite version of the OS DHD or &quot;Dial Home Device&quot; by <a href="http://www.oslabs.info/">OS Labs</a> (<a href="http://www.oslabs.info/">http://www.oslabs.info/</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Tollan</strong> - This is a <em>concept</em> DHD built by Lex Mars and scripted by Zachary Carter to compliment the Tollan Stargate.</li>
	<li><strong>Forerunner</strong> - This is a <em>concept</em> DHD built by Lex Mars and scripted by Zachary Carter to compliment the Forerunner Stargate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These DHDs allow for direct glyph entry into the gates to dial a destination. Using the website, the <a href="#s3.5">address display</a>, or another 3rd party device, you can obtain the glyph address to dial your Stargate. Input the 6 (or 7) glyphs of your Stargate and press the center button. The gate will spin up, and hopefully lock and activate. More help on how to use the DHD are found earlier in the guide in <em>Sections 1 and 2</em>.</p>
<p>These devices will only work on Stargates that you own. They will also listen to any gate in the region, so having multiple gates (of the same network) owned by yourself and attempting to use this device is not a good idea.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>3.3 - Address Display<a name="s3.3" id="top40" /></a></a></a></h3>
<p>The address display is a free way to display obtain glyph addresses without using the website. Rez this object from your inventory, and use the following commands below to control it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>/lookup <strong>network keyword</strong></em></li>
	<li><em>/clear</em></li>
	<li><em>/setnetwork <strong>network</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>network</em> parameter in the lookup command is either <strong><em>milkyway</em></strong> or <em><strong>pegasus</strong></em>. It is not required to have the network parameter however; it will simply use the network you set when you used the <em>/setnetwork</em> command (see below).</p>
<p>The <em>/clear</em> command is a simple command to clear the address display. Please note that changing the names of the displays (from 1-7) could cause it to break.</p>
<p>The<em> /setnetwork</em> command allows you to set the gate network you are dialing from. For example, if you are placing a display by a Milkyway Stargate, you would say &quot;<em>/setnetwork milkyway</em>.&quot; The device automatically defaults at <strong>milkyway</strong>.</p>
<p>When rezzed, it will listen to your gate and light up the address on incoming / outgoing, and also light up <strong>your</strong> Stargate's address when idle. Use this key to determine what address it is showing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>White - Looked up address</li>
  <li><font color="orange">Orange</font> / <font color="aqua">Aqua</font> - Milkyway / Pegasus native address (your Stargate's address)</li>
	<li><font color="red">Red</font> / <font color="blue">Blue</font> - Incoming / Outgoing wormhole</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.4 - Stargate Control Unit<a name="s3.4" id="top41" /></a></a></a></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Stargate Control Unit</strong> is to be thought of as &quot;The Poor Man's DHD.&quot; Basically, it allows for commands such as Reset, Shield, etc. It also has a built-in directory for preset dialing buttons. The model for this was based off of the control unit the ancients used to take back control of Atlantis in <strong>3x10 The Return Pt. 1</strong>.</p>
<p>All commands can be accessed by touching the device itself and clicking buttons on the menu. When clicking the device itself, you will get a menu with 3 buttons.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Control</strong> - Allows you to control your gate. Examples include the shield, reset, offline, test incoming / outgoing, and random dial.</li>
	<li><strong>Directory</strong> - The directory where you can add in new addresses and dial previously stored ones.</li>
	<li><strong>Options</strong> - Options such as whether to be verbose, whether to play sounds, whether to spin the inner ring, and others can be found in here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The color on the sides determine what gate it is controlling (<span class="style1">aqua</span> if Pegasus, <span class="style2">orange</span> if Milkyway). The small screen at the top will tell the gate's current status.</p>
<p>This device will only work on Stargates that you own. It will also listen to any gate in the region, so having multiple gates (of the same network) owned by yourself and attempting to use this device is not a good idea.</p>

<h2>Section 4 - Stargate API<a name="s4" id="top20" /></a></a></h2>
<p>The Stargates are equipped with an &quot;Application Programming Interface&quot; or API which allows you to interface with our Stargates in both basic and advanced levels. There are two levels of the api, <strong>Public</strong> and <strong>Private</strong>. <strong>Public</strong> allows for anybody to submit the command to your gate, while <strong>Private</strong> is limited to only the Stargate's owner.</p>
<h3>4.1 - Incoming API<a name="s4.1" id="top21" /></a></a></h3>
<p>The incoming API is commands that you can send to the gate in order to control it, change things within it, etc. The channels to interface with each gate are as follows.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pegasus &quot;-804000&quot;</li>
	<li>Milkyway &quot;-904000&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The commands currently accepted on this channel are as below. Notice that <strong>bold</strong> commands are <strong>public</strong> commands while <em>italic</em> commands are <strong>private</strong> commands. The<strong> public</strong> commands will work from any distance for the gate owner, however will only work from up to <em>20m</em> for anyone else.</p>

<h2>Section 6 - Updating your Stargate<a name="s6" id="top28" /></a></h2>
<h3>6.1 - Update Policy<a name="s6.1" id="top29" /></a></h3>
<p>We will try to announce major code updates that may affect gate performance ahead of time, so people have time to prepare. We cannot however guarentee the status of the network at any time, so the network may be taken down periodically for updates or maintenance. We will try to alert both the forums and the in-world group whenever an emergency takedown has taken place.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>6.2 - Types of Updates<a name="s6.2" id="top30" /></a></h3>
<p>The gates will be updated periodically. Some updates will require no new Stargate, some will require just a script update, others will require a system replacement.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cases where no new Stargate will be needed are cases where just a new menu function or API command needs to be added, or a new /stargate command needs to be implemented.</li>
	<li>Cases were just a stargate code update will need to take place is one of the main scripts in the parent prim are updated, where the Stargate can run the updater.</li>
	<li>Cases where the entire Stargate needs to be replaced is where the model is improved, new textures are made, or chevron / inner ring scripts are changed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>6.3 - How to Update<a name="s6.3" id="top31" /></a></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of update, there are different methods on how to go about updating your out-of-date Stargate.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If it was simply a backend fix, the Stargate does not need any changes. If anything, all it needs is a simple <strong>/stargate reset</strong> command.</li>
	<li>If it was a code update, simply rez the update orb near your Stargate and click it. Updates will take place automatically, and the orb will delete itself after.</li>
	<li>If it was a full model update, then the entire Stargate needs to be scrapped and replaced. The update orb provided will replace the entire gate model, as well as transfer the settings for you.</li>

<h2>Section 7 - Troubleshooting<a name="s7" id="top32" /></a></h2>
<h3>7.1 - Common Issues<a name="s7.1" id="top33" /></a></a></h3>
<p>There are several common questions that we get asked frequently that we want to address in this first section.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>My Stargate has frozen mid-dial, or the Stargate has been open for a long period of time (greater than 38 minutes) in the outgoing / incoming state.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Most of the time, this can be addressed with a simple <em>/stargate reset</em> or at the very worst <em>/stargate restart</em>.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The Stargate repeatedly fails when dialing a Stargate in the same region! What's happening!</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The Stargate cannot dial a Stargate of the same type in the same region. This is a limitation of the Stargate in the TV show, and as such we implemented this limitation in our gates.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The Stargate failed the dial when another Stargate was active in my region. Why did it do this?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If another Stargate of the same type in the same region is active, no other gate can become active / recieve incoming. This is again a limitation of the Stargate in the TV show, and we implemented the same limitation in our gates.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Why do we not teleport right after colliding with the event horizon?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Due to scripting limitations, this is currently not possible. However, once the function<em> llTeleportAgent</em> is released, it will be integrated into the Stargate A.S.A.P.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Can you automatically update our Stargates? Does my Stargate update itself?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have created a method of updating other users's Stargates, however, due to the largeness of the network it is unfeasible for us to go and update every Stargate. It is up to the end-user to update their Stargate. You can pick up the latest release at <a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/">http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/</a>.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I get a Stargate?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong> You can pick up your own Stargate by visiting the following URL: <a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/">http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/</a>.</p>

<h3>8.3 - Credit<a name="s8.3" id="top38" /></a></a></h3>
<p>The Stargate is a result of many people's assistance, so we felt credit was needed in several areas.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wes Keynes</strong> - Wes gave many ideas from the start including the Stargate direct dialing and the version indexing. Runs the Cleary Stargate Network.</li>
	<li><strong>Mintopia Ambassador</strong> - His first Stargate gave the spark to start the original network that lead to the creation of this network.</li>
	<li><strong>Reyo Neutra</strong> - Creator of the original (but retired) Stargate model of Mintopia's original Stargate and our original Stargate model.</li>
	<li><strong>Geordie Boffin</strong> - Creator of the original textures on the original model of Mintopia's Stargate and our first model. Since then been replaced.</li>
	<li><strong>Lex Mars</strong> - New gate size, textures, sounds, diameter, and coded the pegasus inner ring movement.</li>
	<li><strong>Wolfie Waves</strong> - Creator of the original Arcturus 4.0 gate model which was cannibalized to create the Alteran 1.0 model. Also the writer of the original help guide which this is based off of.</li>
	<li><strong>Kirby Figtree</strong> - Located <a href="http://web.mac.com/david_of_mac/">David Gian-Cursio</a> which provided us with our new event horizon animation and several Stargate core textures.</li>
	<li><strong>Zwagoth Klaar</strong> - Helped create the new PHP code for the backend of the Arcturus 4.0 gates. Helped with several new methods of storing data in the SQL database.</li>
	<li><strong>Kegan Loon</strong> - Provided the idea (and executed it later on) to create the &quot;Automatic Map&quot; system back in 2006.</li>
	<li><strong>Peter Lameth</strong> - The heart of the network, he created the original Stargate code for the first network. We would not be here today without Peter's hard work.</li>
	<li><strong>Ash Qin</strong>  - Provided the concept of using the owner-uuid in the URL for blacklisting purposes.</li>
         <li><strong>Jandav Auer</strong> - A programmer with knowledge way beyond Zachary's who took the event horizon and rewrote the collision logic so that you didn't keep getting killed every time you walked through a Stargate ;)</li>
