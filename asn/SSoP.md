<h2 id="key-definitions">Key Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASN Hub: The main server/service that lists and connects all Stargates. Blocking it can disable your gate.</li>
<li>GDO (Gate Dialing Object): A HUD or handheld device allowing users to dial and interact with Stargates.</li>
<li>RP (Role Play) Gate: A Stargate used primarily for thematic or storyline scenarios (for example, &quot;space gates&quot; or fantasy realms).</li>
<li>Random Dialing: A feature enabling the gate to establish random connections across the network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-enforcement-rules">General Enforcement Rules</h2>
<p>These rules apply to all Stargates, whether they allow random dialing or manual dialing.</p>
<h3 id="asn-hub-access">ASN Hub Access</h3>
<p>Blocking the ASN Hub or preventing your gate from connecting to it will result in gate deactivation until fixed.</p>
<h3 id="avatar-attachments">Avatar Attachments</h3>
<p>Stargates should not be worn or attached to avatars; they must be placed in-world.</p>
<h2 id="public-access-stargates">Public Access Stargates</h2>
<p>These are for Stargates that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are not set to offline.</li>
<li>Do not have a shield raised.</li>
<li>Configured to exist in the Random dialing pool (enabled by default, you can disable it in Settings -&gt; Random).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quick-refrence-checklist">Quick Refrence Checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use: It is possible to use the Stargate to leave.</li>
<li>Security: No automatic eject/ban systems within gate range.</li>
<li>Scripting: Public scripts are enabled close to the the gate.</li>
<li>Visibility: Gate is easily spotted from the Telehub or arrival point.</li>
<li>Land Access: Parcel is open to the public (not group-only or private).</li>
<li>Aerial Placement: If gate is above ground, a safe landing mechanism is present.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="land-access">Land access</h3>
<p>Rule:
Stargates must be placed on land that is publicly accessible (i.e., not group-only or private).</p>
<p>Exception:
Stargates can be placed on private no access regions that have the experience key &quot;<a href="secondlife:///app/experience/d14a12a0-b48b-11e5-bf4d-fa4c4c646b81/profile">Matter stream</a>&quot; configured as a &quot;Key Experience&quot; in the Region/Estate panel.</p>
<p>Reason:
Ensures anyone can visit and use the gate, regardless of group affiliation or land permissions.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your parcel&#39;s &quot;About Land&quot; -&gt; &quot;Access&quot; settings to confirm public entry is allowed.</li>
<li>Check &quot;Region/Estate&quot; -&gt; &quot;Experiences&quot; options to confirm that &quot;Matter stream&quot; is configured if &quot;Allow only residents and groups listed in access tab&quot; is selected in te &quot;Estate tab&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aerial-placement">Aerial placement</h3>
<p>Rule:
Do not place Stargates in mid-air unless there is a clear, safe mechanism for travelers to land or disembark.</p>
<p>Exception:
[RP] &quot;Space Gates&quot; with &quot;power pods&quot; or other thematic support.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a platform or teleporter if your gate is above ground level.</li>
<li>Consider adding &quot;Space Gate&quot; or &quot;[RP]&quot; in the gate name or alias for easy identification.</li>
<li>For space gates, you can place a 10x10x1 meter invisible platform right under where the event horizon should be to catch visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visbility-teleportation">Visbility &amp; Teleportation</h3>
<p>Rule:
The Stargate should be visible from the region&#39;s Telehub or primary landing point.</p>
<p>Reason:
Prevents confusion and makes it easy for new arrivals to locate the gate.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t use teleport routing on the parcel that the Stargate sits.</li>
<li>If you use teleport rourting on the parcel that the Stargate sits on, make sure the user has direct line of sight to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-systems">Security Systems</h3>
<p>Rule:
Avoid placing Stargates within areas that have automatic security or ban systems that teleport or eject users on entry.</p>
<p>Reason:
Users risk being expelled immediately upon arrival, rendering the gate unusable.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivate security orbs in the gate&#39;s vicinity.</li>
<li>Move Stargate or &#39;secured&#39; zone away from affecting each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="public-script-usage">Public Script Usage</h3>
<p>Rule:
Stargates must be placed on land where public scripts are enabled.</p>
<p>Reason:
Prevents interference with GDOs (Gate Dialing Objects) and other scripted interactions.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>In &quot;About Land&quot; -&gt; &quot;Options,&quot; confirm &quot;Scripts allowed&quot; is checked for public users.</li>
<li>If you can&#39;t enable public scripts for the entire region, consider isolating the gate on a dedicated parcel where scripts are permitted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gate-dialing-puzzles">Gate Dialing Puzzles</h3>
<p>Rule:
Dialing puzzles or unique interactive mechanisms are allowed but must not be overly hidden or complicated.</p>
<p>Reason:
Encourages Stargate play but keeps the gate accessible to casual visitors.</p>
<p>Implementation Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide in-world hints why a Stargate may not behave as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exceptions-for-roleplay">Exceptions for Roleplay</h3>
<p>If you are using a gate in a roleplay setting, clearly mark it with &quot;[RP]&quot; in the gate&#39;s name or alias. You may use special rules. Just be sure to communicate these differences to visitors through the gate name.</p>
<h2 id="montioring-reporting">Montioring &amp; Reporting</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can report a gate directly by clicking on it.</li>
<li>You can find the gate using the <a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/db/">ASN Database </a> and report it through that interface.</li>
<li>You can view tickets against your gates or tickets you&#39;ve opened against other gates via the <a href="http://www.alpha-fox.com/support/ssop/">SSoP support portal</a></li>
