Alpha-Fox automatically uses your [Gravatar](https://www.gravatar.com) for the email address configured in
your [profile](/edit/profile/). If you don't have a valid Gravatar email address set up, it will automatically fall back
to your `my.secondlife.com` profile picture.

## How to Set Up Your Avatar on Alpha-Fox

To configure your avatar on Alpha-Fox, you have two options:

- **Link to Gravatar**: Set the email address in your Alpha-Fox profile to one registered with Gravatar.
- **Use Second Life**: Upload a profile picture to your Second Life profile.

Occasionally, your my.secondlife.com profile picture may not sync properly with your in-world Second Life profile. If
you notice a mismatch, follow the steps below to resync it.

The Alpha-Fox website should only cache avatars for five minutes at most. After five minutes have passed, you should see
your latest avatar.

## How to Resync Your Second Life Web Profile Picture

This process takes just a few minutes and ensures your my.secondlife.com web profile displays your current profile
picture, even if it has been showing an outdated image for years.

### How Do I Know If I Need to Perform This Procedure?

To determine if resyncing is necessary:

1. Open your my.secondlife.com profile page (e.g., `https://my.secondlife.com/yourusername`, such
   as `https://my.secondlife.com/ash.qin` or `https://my.secondlife.com/subnova`). You can also find a link to it via
   your profile page on Alpha-Fox!
2. Compare the profile picture displayed next to your name with the one in your in-world Second Life profile.

- **Same Image**: No action is needed. You can stop here.
- **Different Image**: Proceed with the resync steps below.

### Steps to Perform the Resync Procedure

Follow these steps to resync your profile picture:

1. In your in-world Second Life profile, remove your profile picture entirely, then save and close the profile.
2. Refresh your `my.secondlife.com` page periodically over the next couple of minutes until it displays the default
   no-photo image instead of the previous picture.
3. In your in-world Second Life profile, select a new profile picture from your inventory or upload a new image using a
   modern viewer. Note that uploading is free and requires no premium account or fee.
4. Refresh your `my.secondlife.com` page periodically over the next couple of minutes until it shows your new profile
   picture instead of the placeholder.

### What to Expect After Resyncing

Once these steps are complete, your `my.secondlife.com` profile picture will be updated and synchronized with your
in-world profile. Services like Alpha-Fox that rely on this image will reflect the update. You won't need to repeat
these steps unless you notice a mismatch again (see "How Do I Know If I Need to Perform This Procedure?" above). If a
non-Second Life website still shows your old image, this may be due to caching, which typically clears automatically
over time.

The Alpha-Fox website should only cache avatars for five minutes at most.
