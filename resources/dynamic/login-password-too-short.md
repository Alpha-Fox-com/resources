## The Importance of Password Length

We've noticed that your current password is too short, which can make it more susceptible to unauthorized access. To
enhance your account's security, it's crucial to create longer, more secure passwords. One effective approach is
inspired by the popular XKCD comic on password strength.

### Why Longer Passwords Matter

Short passwords are vulnerable to various attack methods, such as brute-force attacks, where an attacker systematically
attempts all possible combinations to guess your password. The shorter the password, the fewer combinations an attacker
needs to try, making it easier and faster to crack. Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible
combinations, significantly enhancing security.

### The XKCD Method for Creating Strong Passwords

The XKCD comic "[Password Strength](https://xkcd.com/936/)" illustrates a simple yet effective method for creating
strong passwords: combining four random common words to form a passphrase. This approach leverages the length and
randomness of the passphrase to create a password that's both secure and easy to remember.

**Example:**

```
correct horse battery staple
```

This passphrase is easy to remember but hard for attackers to guess due to its length and randomness.

### Advantages of the XKCD Method

1. **Memorability:** Combining common words into a passphrase creates a password that's easier to remember than a random
   string of characters.

2. **Security:** The length and randomness of the words make the passphrase resistant to common password-cracking
   techniques.

3. **Usability:** Typing a series of common words is often more user-friendly than complex combinations of letters,
   numbers, and symbols.

### How to Create Your Own Secure Passphrase

1. **Select Four Random Words:** Choose four unrelated common words. Avoid using phrases from literature, songs, or
   common expressions, as these can be more predictable.

2. **Ensure Randomness:** The words should be chosen randomly to maximize security. Avoid selecting words that form a
   common phrase or sequence.

3. **Avoid Common Substitutions:** Refrain from predictable substitutions, such as replacing 'a' with '@' or 'o' with '
   0', as these are commonly anticipated by attackers.

**Example Process:**

1. Use a random word generator or a method like [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) to select words
   randomly.

2. Combine the words into a passphrase: `apple river guitar window`

3. Use this passphrase as your password.
