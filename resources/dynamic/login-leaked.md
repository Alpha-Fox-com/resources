## Understanding Password Leaks and How to Stay Safe

We've detected that your password has appeared on a list of passwords leaked from other websites. You might be wondering
what exactly this means, why it matters, and what you should do next. Let's explore everything you need to know in
simple terms.

### What is a Password Leak?

A password leak (also known as a password breach) happens when the security of a website or online service is
compromised. This usually occurs due to cyberattacks, hacking incidents, or accidental security lapses. When this
happens, sensitive data such as usernames, email addresses, and passwords can end up in the hands of unauthorized
individuals or groups who may misuse the information.

### How Does a Password Leak Affect You?

If your password is part of a leaked list, cybercriminals might try to use it to access your accounts on various
websites or online services. This practice is known as "credential stuffing," where attackers attempt to log in to
multiple websites with leaked usernames and passwords, hoping that users reused their credentials across several sites.

If attackers gain access to your accounts, they could:

- View or misuse your personal and financial information
- Access your private communications or photos
- Impersonate you on social media
- Use your accounts for fraudulent activities or scams

### Why Reusing Passwords is Risky

One of the biggest risks that arise from password leaks is the reuse of passwords across multiple accounts. If you reuse
the same password for several services, a leak at one website can potentially compromise all your other accounts.

### What Should You Do Next?

If we've alerted you about your password appearing in a leaked list, follow these steps immediately:

1. **Change your password**
    - Reset your password right away. Choose a unique, strong password that you've never used elsewhere.

2. **Avoid reusing passwords**
    - Ensure each of your online accounts has a unique password. Consider using a reputable password manager to securely
      generate and store strong passwords.

3. **Check other accounts**
    - If you used the same leaked password elsewhere, immediately change it on those accounts too.

### Tips for Creating a Strong Password

- Avoid using obvious personal information like birthdays, anniversaries, or common words.
- Aim for a length of at least 12 characters or more. The longer, the better.
- Consider using a password manager, they can generate and store passwords for each site automatically.

### How We Identify Leaked Passwords

We use secure and reliable third-party services that specialize in detecting leaked passwords. When a password breach
happens elsewhere, these services collect leaked information and allow trusted organizations like ours to inform users
proactively. This enables you to act quickly and protect your accounts.

### Summary

Password leaks are serious, but staying safe online is entirely manageable. By changing compromised passwords, using
unique passwords for each account, and enabling additional security measures like two-factor authentication, you
significantly enhance your security and protect yourself from potential harm.

Stay vigilant, stay informed, and keep your digital life secure.
