## Incorrect Username

You're attempting to login with a non-existent username. You might need
to [create your account first](/resources/account/credentials/)?

If you know you're registered, it's likely due to confusion between your **Legacy Name**, **Username**, and **Display
Name** in Second Life. Let's clarify the differences and help you log in correctly.

### Understanding Second Life Names

Second Life provides different types of names, each serving distinct purposes:

1. **Legacy Name (First & Last Name)**:
    - This is the original format for usernames created before 2010, consisting of a unique first and last name (e.g.,
      `John Doe`).
    - These names are unique and can always be used to log in.

2. **Username (Resident Name)**:
    - Accounts created after 2010 have a single username (e.g., `john123`).
    - Usernames are unique identifiers chosen during account creation.

3. **Display Name**:
    - This is a customizable, visible name in-world (e.g., `Johnny D.`).
    - Display names can be duplicated by other users and are not unique.
    - **Display names cannot be used to log in**.

### Why Can't I Log in With My Display Name?

Display names are not unique and are used only for visual identification within Second Life. Multiple users can choose
the same display name, making it impossible to verify your identity securely with just a display name.

### How to Log in Correctly

To log in successfully, always use your **Legacy Name** or your **Username**:

- If your account was created before 2010, enter your legacy name in the format: `FirstName LastName`.
- If your account was created after 2010, use your single-word username.

**Examples:**

- Legacy Name: `Ash Qin`
- Username: `ash.qin`

- Legacy Name: `Subnova Resident`
- Username: `subnova`

### Important Tips:

- **Never share your login credentials** with anyone.
- Remember, **your display name is not valid for login purposes**.
- Ensure you're entering your username or legacy name accurately, checking for spelling errors or incorrect spaces.
