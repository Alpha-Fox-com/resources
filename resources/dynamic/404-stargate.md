We regret to inform you that the Stargate you are attempting to access within the Alteran Stargate Network cannot be
located in our database. This issue can arise for several reasons:

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Stargate is "Buried"**

    - **Region Restarting:** The destination region may be undergoing a restart, temporarily making the Stargate
      unavailable. During such times, all objects, including Stargates, are inaccessible until the region is back
      online.

    - **Severe Region Lag:** High lag in the destination region can impede the proper functioning of the Stargate,
      preventing successful connections.

2. **Stargate Deletion**

    - The Stargate you are attempting to access may have been removed from the destination region. This could be due to
      land ownership changes, region repurposing, or the owner's decision to dismantle the Stargate setup.

3. **Stargate Never Existed**

    - It's possible that the Stargate address you are using never existed. This could result from typographical errors
      in the address or outdated information referencing an incorrect or non-existent Stargate.

**Recommended Actions:**

- **Verify the Stargate Address:** Double-check the accuracy of the Stargate identity you are using. Ensure there are no
  typographical errors or outdated information.

- **Consult the Destination Region's Status:** Use Second Life's map or region status tools to check if the destination
  region is online and functioning properly.

- **Contact the Stargate Owner or Region Manager:** If possible, reach out to the owner or manager of the destination
  region to inquire about the status of the Stargate.

- **Retry After Some Time:** If the issue is due to a region restart or temporary lag, waiting and attempting to connect
  later may resolve the problem.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding as we strive to maintain a
seamless experience within the Alteran Stargate Network.
