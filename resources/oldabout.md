# Welcome to Alpha-Fox

Alpha-Fox is a group founded in 2007 by Zachary Carter in the virtual world of Second Life速. We create products and
services that will make the residents' lives easier. We do this through creating the most innovative and unique products
we can, and making them the best they can be.

In Second Life, we are based inside of the region [Subnova](secondlife:///Subnova/128/128/22/). We host services such as
the *AFVI* system that allow a quick and reliable communication bridge between the outside world and the grid. We also
create products such as the *Transport Rings* and the *Zat'niki'tel* using LSL, a scripting language used on the grid.
In our spare time, we also run the largest Stargate Network in the Second Life速 world.

## Team Members

We draw our team members from many different fields of expertise, ensuring a full range of skills available for anything
we do.

## Partners

In order to assist our services, we form partnerships with organizations to benefit both sides. Currently, we are in
collaboration with the following organizations:

- **Subnova** - Our recent partnership with [Subnova](http://www.subnova.com/) has allowed us to move our Second Life速
  based services to a more reliable server, as well as allowed us to establish our foothold in Second Life.
- **OS Labs** - Our partnership with the Second Life速 based group, [OS Labs](http://www.oslabs.info/), has allowed us to
  include high-quality DHDs in our Stargate package distributed in-world.
- **crazyLabs** - The partnership with crazyLabs allows us to collaborate on some larger projects (such as the Alteran
  Stargate Network).
- **Quickfox** - The partnership with Quickfox allows us to provide the #alphafox IRC channel as well as some new
  security technologies for the Stargate and other systems.

## Services and Projects

- **Alpha-Fox Virtual Interface** - A replacement service to the failing XML-RPC interface on the grid. It allows
  verifiable communication between the outside world and objects within the grid itself. It also provides a method of
  sending out regular e-mails in-world, as well as sending instant-messages to avatars on the grid. You can find more
  information about this service by [clicking here](https://www.alpha-fox.com/vi/).
- **Alteran Stargate Network** - A completely free Stargate Network that has been in development since late 2005. You
  can find more information about this network by [clicking here](https://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/).

## Product Listings

- **Zatnikitel Sidearm** - A handweapon from Stargate SG-1 that resulted from joint development by Zachary Carter and
  Lex Mars. Features include a "one shot stun; two shot kill" system, as well as a simple point-and-shoot interface.
- **Alpha-Fox Teleport Systems** - Teleport systems unlike any other, the Alpha-Fox Teleport Systems are completely
  customizable and backend-server based teleport system for inter-region teleportation. Coming in multiple styles, these
  teleporters are possibly the most sophisticated in Second Life.

## Goals

- **Powerful, but simple** - We want to make our products easy to use, but not compromise any potential features. We
  will try to create products that are both powerful *and* easy-to-use.
- **Strong Customer Support** - You can create a product. You can sell that product. However, without quality customer
  service, you may not have very happy customers. We are committed to offering the highest level of customer service. If
  you've found a bug, have a problem, or need support, our support team will give you the help you need, and quickly at
  that.
- **Large Customer Base** - You can advertise all you want, but a strong customer base is the best advertising ever. We
  have many customers, and many of our products are sold simply by word-of-mouth.
