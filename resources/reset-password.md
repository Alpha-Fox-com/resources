## **Initial Setup & Login Credentials**

When you first set up your **Stargate**, it automatically generates a unique **username** and **password**. These
credentials grant access to the **online interface**, so be sure to save them securely.

### **Username Changes in Second Life**

If your **Second Life username** has changed, your **Alpha-Fox login username** will update automatically. However, this
update may not take effect immediately. You may need to **rez a Stargate** before the system detects the change.

## **Which Username Should You Use to Log In?**

You can log in using either of the following:

‚úÖ **Legacy Name** (
e.g., [Ash Qin](https://my.secondlife.com/ash.qin), [Subnova Resident](https://my.secondlife.com/subnova))  
‚úÖ **Username** (e.g., [ash.qin](https://my.secondlife.com/ash.qin), [subnova](https://my.secondlife.com/subnova))

‚ùå **Display names CANNOT be used**, as they are not unique.

## **Obtaining a Stargate**

If you don't have a Stargate yet, you can get one here:  
üëâ **[Get a Stargate](https://www.alpha-fox.com/asn/get/)**

## **How to Reset Your Password**

If you forget or lose your password, you can **reset it using your Stargate**.

### **Steps to Reset Your Password:**

1. **Rez your Stargate** in Second Life.
2. Open **local chat** and enter the following command:
   ```
   /stargate resetpass
   ```  
3. Your password will be **reset**, allowing you to log back into the website.

### **Additional Notes:**

- If you continue experiencing login issues, ensure that your **username is correct** and that your **Stargate is rezzed
  out and online**.
- You **cannot** use a Stargate **owned by another user** to reset your password.
- For additional support, reach out to us on **Discord**.
